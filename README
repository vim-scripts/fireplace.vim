There's a REPL in fireplace, but you probably wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't told you.  Such is the way with fireplace.vim.  By the way, this plugin is for Clojure.

Partial feature list:

* Transparent setup and automatic connection.
* Evaluate code from the buffer or arbitrary input.
* Jump to namespace or function definitions.
* Wrappers for source, doc, and macroexpand.
* Omnicomplete.

See http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/vim_fireplace.html for help getting started.
